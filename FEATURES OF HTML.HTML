<h2>Key features of HTML</h2>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental language for creating and structuring web content. It provides developers with tools to build and organize web pages, making it a cornerstone of web development.<br><br>Key features of HTML include:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Structural elements</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML uses predefined tags, such as header, p, table, and a, to define and organize the different parts of a web page.</li>
<li id="square">These tags structure content into logical sections, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and other elements, ensuring proper display and organization within the document.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Hyperlinks and navigation</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML's core feature, hypertext, enables the creation of hyperlinks using the a (anchor) tag.</li>
<li id="square">These links allow users to navigate between different web pages or sections within a page, forming the interconnected web.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Multimedia support</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML facilitates embedding multimedia content like images, audio, and video directly into web pages using tags like img, audio, and video.</li>
<li id="square">HTML5, the latest version, enhances multimedia support by providing built-in tags and APIs for richer media experiences, reducing the reliance on external plugins.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Forms and user input</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML provides elements like input, select, and textarea to create interactive forms that collect user data for tasks like registration, surveys, or login.</li>
<li id="square">HTML5 introduced new form elements and input types, like email, date, and URL, for better user experience and data validation.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Semantic elements</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML5 introduced semantic elements, such as article, section, header, and footer, that offer a more descriptive meaning to web content, improving accessibility and SEO performance.</li>
<li id="square">These elements provide better context for screen readers and search engine crawlers, making content more understandable and searchable. </li>
</ul>
<li><b>Accessibility</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML supports features that make web pages accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.</li>
<li id="square">Semantic tags, alt attributes for images, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are crucial for creating websites compatible with assistive technologies like screen readers.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Platform independence</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML files can be rendered on any device or platform with a web browser, ensuring consistent display and functionality regardless of the operating system or device type.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Integration with other technologies</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML integrates with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic functionality.</li>
<li id="square">This combination allows developers to create visually appealing and feature-rich websites that cater to diverse user needs.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Search engine optimization (SEO)</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML plays a crucial role in SEO by allowing developers to structure content effectively, use relevant heading tags (title, meta), and incorporate keywords for better visibility and ranking in search results.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>Ease of learning and use</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">HTML is known for its straightforward syntax and is relatively easy to learn, especially for beginners in web development.</li>
<li id="square">Its simplicity allows developers to quickly grasp the basics and start building web pages without needing extensive programming knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, HTML provides a foundation for web development, allowing developers to create well-structured, accessible, and user-friendly web pages. Its ability to integrate with CSS and JavaScript opens up possibilities for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences.</p>
