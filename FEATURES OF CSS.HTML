<h2>Key features of CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language crucial for defining the presentation and styling of web documents written in HTML or XML.<br><br>Here are its key features:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Separation of Content and Presentation</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">CSS distinguishes the structure of web content (HTML) from its appearance (styling). This allows developers to change the visual design of a website without altering the underlying content, making maintenance easier and promoting consistency across multiple pages.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Cascading and Specificity</b></li>
<ul>
<li id="square"> The "cascading" aspect refers to a prioritized scheme that determines which CSS rules are applied when conflicts arise (e.g., if multiple rules target the same element). This prioritization is based on factors such as importance, inline styles, media types, selector specificity, and rule order.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Styling Capabilities</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">CSS offers a wide range of properties to control visual aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, background images, and more.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Selectors</b></li>
<ul>
<li id="square">CSS utilizes selectors to pinpoint specific HTML elements or groups of elements for styling based on factors like tag name, ID, class, attributes, and relationships to other elements.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Responsive Web Design</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">CSS is essential for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Animations and Transitions</b></li>
<ul>
<li id="square">CSS supports animations and transitions, enabling interactive elements and improving user experience without relying solely on JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Enhanced Accessibility</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">CSS aids in creating more accessible websites by controlling elements like font sizes, colors, and contrast levels, which can be adjusted for users with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Device Compatibility</b></li>
<ul>
<li id="square">CSS ensures consistent design and functionality across various devices and platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Faster Loading Times</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">By separating styles into external CSS files, browsers can cache these files, leading to quicker page loads and a better user experience, especially for returning visitors.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>SEO-Friendly</b></li>
<ul>
<li id="square">Well-structured CSS can improve a website's search engine optimization by making it easier for search engine crawlers to read and index the content.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Layout Systems</b></li>
<ul>
<li class="disc">CSS provides powerful layout systems like Flexbox and CSS Grid for creating complex and responsive web designs. </li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>These features collectively make CSS a cornerstone technology for designing visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive websites.</p>
